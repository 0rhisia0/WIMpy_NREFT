## NREFT form factors

The nuclear form factors are written in the form:
$$
F_X^{(N, N')} = \mathrm{e}^{-2y}\sum_{k} c_k y^k\,.
$$
The definition of the dimensionless momentum variable y can be found in e.g. Appendix A.3 of [arXiv:1203.3542](https://arxiv.org/abs/1203.3542).

The form factors tables give the coefficients $c_k$ from $k = 0$ to $k = 7$ on each row. For each form factor $F_X$ there are 4 rows, corresponding to:
$F_X^{(p,p)}\,,$
$F_X^{(p,n)}\,,$
$F_X^{(n,p)}\,,$
$F_X^{(n,n)}\,.$

The different form factors are listed in the following order (with 4 rows for each, as described above):
$$
F_M, \,\,F_{\Sigma'}, \,\, F_{\Sigma''}^{(p,p)}, \,\, F_{\Delta}, \,\, F_{\Phi''}, \,\, F_{M,\Phi''}, \,\, F_{\Sigma',\Delta}\,.
$$

Note that the form factor $F_{\tilde{\Phi}'}$ is not (yet) included, and therefore the results are only valid for operators up to $\mathcal{O}_{11}$.
